    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb (450g) ground beef or pork</li>
        <li>1/2 cup breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup finely chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup ketchup</li>
        <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vinegar (white or apple cider)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch (optional, for thickening)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the ground meat, breadcrumbs, onion, egg, garlic, salt, and pepper. Mix until well combined.</li>
        <li>Form the mixture into small meatballs, about 1 inch in diameter.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the meatballs and cook until browned on all sides, about 8-10 minutes. Remove the meatballs from the skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet, combine the ketchup, brown sugar, vinegar, soy sauce, and cornstarch (if using). Stir until the sauce is well mixed and begins to thicken.</li>
        <li>Add the meatballs back to the skillet and coat them in the sauce. Cook for an additional 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the meatballs are heated through and well coated in the sauce.</li>
        <li>Serve the sweet and sour meatballs hot, over rice or with toothpicks for easy serving.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>Feel free to adjust the sweetness and tanginess of the sauce by adding more sugar or vinegar to taste. You can also add vegetables like bell peppers or pineapple chunks to the dish for added flavor and texture.</p>
    <p>These meatballs can be made ahead of time and reheated before serving. They also freeze well, making them a great option for meal prep.</p>
